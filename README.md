# Description

***
AS A Marketing Agency, Horiseon Social Solution Services
I WANT to refactor the existing codebase to follow current accessibility standards
SO THAT the website is optimized for search engines
The project will include review and refactor of index.html and styles.css to ensure the codebase meets the following:
•	current requirements for accessibility standards
•	proper and efficient usage, consolidation, and organization of semantic elements and CSS selectors and properties
•	review and correction for any issues that may affect the proper rendering of the website
